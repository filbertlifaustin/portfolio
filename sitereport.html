                <h1>Reflection of My First Assignment</h1>
                <p>To be honest, this is my first time coding a website with HTML and CSS. I have previously created
                    websites with google sites and wordpress, which are just drag and drop. I didn't expect that it
                    would be
                    this difficult to fully code a website. I am writing this reflection after finishing 5 HTML and 3
                    CSS
                    files and I feel very relieved. I finished this website at 9pm on 26 March, 3 hours before the due
                    date.
                    I will try to explain the process of what I have created on this website.</p>
                <h2>Wireframe, Mockup, and Colour Palette</h2>
                <figure>
                    <img src="image/site_1.jpg" alt="">
                    <img src="image/site_2.jpg" alt="">
                </figure>
                <p>Before I started coding, I decided to work on the wireframe and mockup first. In the process of
                    making a
                    mockup, the choice of colour composition, font combination, and supporting elements is quite
                    important.
                    So I chose to use a custom 3D avatar creator called Peeps to support the illustrations, the rest I
                    made
                    manually using CorelDraw. Since this is a personal website, I chose my favourite colour combination
                    of
                    blue, red and yellow, and to create contrast I chose a base colour of white and navy blue. </p>
                <h2>Ups and Downs During the Coding Process</h2>
                <figure>
                    <img src="image/site_3.jpg" alt="">
                    <img src="image/site_4.jpg" alt="">
                    <img src="image/site_5.jpg" alt="">
                    <img src="image/site_6.jpg" alt="">
                </figure>
                <p>As a newbie, I found it very difficult because I was not familiar with 'margin', 'padding',
                    'display',
                    etc. I felt that it was the CSS, not the HTML, that was difficult. Speaking honestly, I spent about
                    4
                    days to finish it. There was a time when I felt all my work was messed up because I didn't read the
                    brief carefully, so I deleted the file and started all the work from the beginning again. I tried my
                    best to make the design as close to the mockup as possible, although in the end I needed to change
                    some
                    divs to make the CSS coding easier. Another difficult part, in my opinion, is the mobile CSS
                    code
                    because there are many parts that can't fit directly into the mobile size. Of course my favourite
                    part
                    was when everything was set in place and working properly.</p>
